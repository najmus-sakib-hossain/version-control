# Now, here is the biggest task - you have to create it production ready and following all pro standards -

So, as you know forge is just not VCS - it also controls the dx-tools version alonside decides what tools to runs in what order of dx-tools - So, you have to make this forge put a forge rust crate that I will publish on crates and will later use it in other dx-tools - dx has so many tools - some of the closes upcoming packages are:

1. style - css generator from classnames but 100 times faster than tailwindcss that is build using oxide and rust
2. internationalization - can generate locales for 256 languages for free unlimited and also can generate tts for 256 languages free and unlimited - just editing the main locales/en.json file
3. ui - can add any components from dx-r2 storage - thing like them as shadcn component but more professional component + more better design and more components!!! so in any js, jsx, ts, tsx file when you write "dx followed by a component name from dx-ui it dx will remove that text and put a import line at the top of the time and then adds the components in the right path - plus you get intellicense in code editors or just go the website and copy that less than one line code if you want or just from the website there's a feature called cart where you select more component in just one copy - this is where our branching has to truly shine with green, red, yellow brancing!!! But they should added for all tools
4. icons - like dx-ui, you just have to write dxi and a code editor interllicence will pop up and will choose right icon for you job from more than 150 sets of icon pack and more than 1m+ icons
5. fonts - like ui and icons it will be similar with giving you 1000+ fonts
6. check - it will format and lint files on save or changes
7. auth - like the ui, icon and fonts it will add or remove files related to auth as you write code - like if you write something that needs google social media then ti will pop inside right folder so you only get what files you need

So, as you can by doing so you will only get what you need - it will beat nodejs, npm, bun, yarn, pnpm as using those you also download so much package that may need but in many cases you just need a arguably small logic from that huge node_modules folder and other files can have some files that has low security and if they do have low security then you basically have no way as node_modules folde ris huge enough to not be verified and you have the mentality that you install a package and it solves everything but most of the time the thing you need is probly more easier to even bother installing it inside node_modules and when you are deploying it to the cloud even the node_modules folder counts - so dx will beat them as you will get the code inside the files and folder that you see so they will be transparent and has to be smaller by even point from the developer writing those package in dx - so this way dx will beat everyone!!!

Now, make sure to make this forge to provide files changes trigger by LSP or file save via Dual-Watcher Architecture - then provide separate versioning for dx-tools and ability to orcastrate tools stating and ending point so that other dx tool can obey it correctly!!!
