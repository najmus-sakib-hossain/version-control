# ✅ Diff Display Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented diff display in Forge's logging output. The timing logs now show what changed AFTER the performance metrics, ensuring diff rendering doesn't count toward detection time.

## Implementation

### Changes Made

**File**: `src/watcher/detector.rs`

1. **Added `print_operation_diff()` function**:
   - Displays detailed diff information from operations
   - Shows insert/delete/replace changes with context
   - Color-coded output (green for additions, red for deletions, yellow for changes)
   - Displays after timing information (doesn't affect performance metrics)

2. **Modified `emit_operations()` function**:
   - Clones operations before processing for diff display
   - Calls `print_operation_diff()` AFTER all timing is complete
   - Ensures diff rendering time doesn't count in performance metrics

### Output Format

#### Timing Log (First)

```
⚙️ detect \\?\F:\Code\forge\README.md | total=72µs
```

#### Diff Display (After)

```
  + README.md @ 5:15
    ## ⚡ Performance Testing
    ... 25 chars total
```

or for replacements:

```
  ~ README.md @ 5:15
    - Performance - Testing Diffs!
    + Performance Testing
```

### Features

**Operation Types Displayed**:

1. **Insert** (`+` green):
   - Shows filename @ line:column
   - Displays inserted content (first 3 lines)
   - Shows total character count if > 100 chars

2. **Delete** (`-` red):
   - Shows filename @ line:column
   - Displays character count deleted

3. **Replace** (`~` yellow):
   - Shows filename @ line:column
   - Displays old content (red)
   - Displays new content (green)
   - Truncates to 50 chars with preview

4. **File Create** (`✨` green):
   - Shows filename with line count

5. **File Delete** (`🗑️` red):
   - Shows filename only

6. **File Rename** (`📋` yellow):
   - Shows old → new filename

### Performance Impact

**Zero impact on detection metrics**:

- Diff display happens AFTER timing is recorded
- Operations are cloned before timing ends
- `print_operation_diff()` is called outside the timed section

**Current performance**: 55-72µs (within sub-100µs target)

## Code Structure

```rust
fn emit_operations(...) -> Result<()> {
    let ops_for_diff = ops.clone(); // Clone before timing
    
    for op in ops {
        // ... timing happens here ...
        record_throughput(total_us); // Timing ends
    }
    
    // 🎨 Display AFTER timing (doesn't count)
    print_operation_diff(&ops_for_diff);
    
    Ok(())
}

fn print_operation_diff(ops: &[Operation]) {
    for op in ops {
        match &op.op_type {
            OperationType::Insert { ... } => { /* show insertion */ }
            OperationType::Delete { ... } => { /* show deletion */ }
            OperationType::Replace { ... } => { /* show replacement */ }
            // ... etc
        }
    }
}
```

## Validation

✅ **Performance**: 55-72µs (meets target)
✅ **Diff Display**: Shows after timing logs
✅ **No Impact**: Diff rendering doesn't affect metrics
✅ **Clean Output**: Color-coded, easy to read
✅ **Detailed**: Shows line:column and content changes

## Usage

### Default Mode

```bash
cargo run --release
```

Shows timing + diffs only when changes detected

### With Profiling

```bash
DX_WATCH_PROFILE=1 cargo run --release
```

Shows all timing logs + diffs for every detection

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Context lines**: Show ±3 lines around changes (like git diff)
2. **Unified diff format**: Use traditional `@@` markers
3. **Word-level diff**: Highlight specific word changes within lines
4. **Configurable verbosity**: `DX_DIFF_LEVEL=0|1|2` for control
5. **Diff summary**: Show total lines added/deleted
