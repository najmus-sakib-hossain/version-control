# Forge - Ultra-Fast CRDT Version Control

Ultra-fast file watcher library with dual-mode event system optimized for DX tools. Operation-level version control powered by CRDTs. Forge tracks file edits as fine-grained operations, persists them in a local DeltaDB, and keeps peers in sync over WebSockets.

## ⚡⚡ Dual-Watcher Architecture

Forge uses a **dual-watcher system** for maximum performance and quality:

### 🚀 Mode 1: RAPID Detection (<20µs)

- **Zero syscalls** - Uses atomic sequence counter (no time calls!)
- **No file operations** - Skips metadata, mtime, and content reads
- **Instant feedback** - Ultra-fast change logging
- **Target: <20µs** - Ultra-fast notification system

### 📊 Mode 2: QUALITY Detection (<60µs)

- **Full file analysis** - Complete operation detection with line numbers
- **Rich metadata** - Diffs, timestamps, and sync details
- **Background execution** - Runs after rapid mode
- **Target: <60µs** - Fast detailed analysis

Both modes run sequentially for every file change, providing instant feedback (rapid) followed by complete details (quality).

## ✨ Features

- **⚡ Rapid Events**: <35µs ultra-fast change notifications (typically 1-2µs)
- **📊 Quality Events**: <60µs full operation detection with line numbers and diffs
- **🚀 Production Ready**: Zero environment variables, optimal hardcoded settings
- **🔧 CRDT-based**: Conflict-free replicated data types for distributed sync
- **💾 Memory-mapped I/O**: Leverages OS page cache for sub-microsecond reads
- **🎯 DX-focused**: Built specifically as a base for developer experience tools

## 🎯 Performance Targets

- **RAPID mode**: <20µs change detection ✅ **ACHIEVED: 3-20µs**
- **QUALITY mode**: <100µs operation detection ⚠️ **CURRENT: ~60-300µs**
- **Total latency**: <320µs for complete processing
- **Debounce**: 1ms ultra-fast mode
- **Inspired by**: dx-style project's <100µs techniques

### Current Performance

**RAPID mode**: ✅ Target exceeded (3µs is 6x faster than 20µs goal!)
**QUALITY mode**: ⚠️ 58-301µs (varies by edit type - appends are fast, full diffs slower)

```bash
# Small appends (cached, best case)
⚡ [RAPID 3µs] test.txt changed
✨ [QUALITY 58µs | total 61µs] test.txt - 1 ops

# Regular edits (typical case)
⚡ [RAPID 20µs] test.txt changed
🐢 [QUALITY 301µs | total 321µs] test.txt - 1 ops
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### As a Library Dependency

Add to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
forge = "1.0"
tokio = { version = "1.48", features = ["full"] }
```

### Basic Usage

```rust
use forge::{ForgeWatcher, ForgeEvent};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    // Create watcher for current directory
    let watcher = ForgeWatcher::new(".", false, vec![]).await?;

    // Run the watcher
    watcher.run().await?;
    Ok(())
}
```

### Running Examples

```bash
# Simple watcher example
cargo run --release --example simple

# Full CLI with all features
cargo run --release --bin forge
```

```bash
# Default mode (dual-watcher enabled)
cargo run --release

# Enable profiling to see timings
DX_WATCH_PROFILE=1 cargo run --release

# Disable rapid mode (quality only, for testing)
DX_DISABLE_RAPID_MODE=1 cargo run --release
```

## 🎯 Dual-Event System

Forge emits **two types of events** for every file change:

### 1. ⚡ Rapid Event (<35µs)

Ultra-fast notification using zero syscalls:

- **Timing**: Typically 1-2µs, max 35µs
- **Purpose**: Instant UI feedback for formatters/linters
- **Method**: Atomic sequence counter (no file I/O)
- **Data**: File path + timing only

### 2. ✨ Quality Event (<60µs)

Complete operation detection with details:

- **Timing**: Typically <60µs
- **Purpose**: Full analysis for quality tools
- **Method**: Memory-mapped I/O + SIMD diffs
- **Data**: Operations, line numbers, content changes

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `DX_WATCH_PROFILE=1` - Show detailed timing for both modes
- `DX_DISABLE_RAPID_MODE=1` - Disable rapid mode (quality only)
- `DX_DEBOUNCE_MS=1` - Debounce interval (default: 1ms)

### Performance Markers

- ⚡ RAPID mode ≤20µs (target achieved)
- 🐌 RAPID mode >20µs (needs optimization)
- ✨ QUALITY mode ≤60µs (target achieved)
- 🐢 QUALITY mode >60µs (needs optimization)

**Clean output - only shows when there are changes!**

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

Rapid Mode (Change Detection):
  ⚡ Best case:  1-2µs  (cached, atomic only)
  ⚡ Typical:    8-20µs (95th percentile)
  🎯 Target:    <35µs  ✅ ACHIEVED

Quality Mode (Full Analysis):
  ✨ Best case:  58µs   (simple append)
  ✨ Typical:    60µs   (typical edits)
  🐢 Worst case: 301µs  (complex diffs)
  🎯 Target:    <60µs  ⚠️ MOSTLY ACHIEVED

### Example Output

```text
⚡ [RAPID 8µs] test.txt changed
✨ [QUALITY 52µs | total 60µs]

- test.txt @ 1:1
    Hello, Forge!
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

- **Watcher**: File system monitoring with 1ms debounce
- **CRDT**: Automerge + Yrs for conflict-free merging
- **Storage**: SQLite + LZ4 compression for operation log
- **Sync**: WebSocket-based real-time synchronization
- **Cache**: Memory-mapped file pool + OS page cache warming

### Event Flow

```text
File Change
    ↓
[1ms Debounce]
    ↓
⚡ Rapid Detection (1-2µs)
    ↓ atomic counter
    ↓ emit rapid event
    ↓
✨ Quality Detection (60µs)
    ↓ mmap read
    ↓ SIMD diff
    ↓ emit quality event
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Production Settings (Hardcoded)

```rust
const RAPID_MODE_ENABLED: bool = true;   // Always on
const DEBOUNCE_MS: u64 = 1;              // 1ms optimal
const RAPID_TARGET_US: u128 = 35;        // <35µs rapid
const QUALITY_TARGET_US: u128 = 60;      // <60µs quality
```

No environment variables needed - everything is optimized out of the box!

## 📦 Use Cases

Perfect for building DX tools that need:

1. **Formatters**: Rapid events trigger instant formatting
2. **Linters**: Quality events provide detailed analysis
3. **Hot Reload**: Rapid events for instant dev server refresh
4. **Build Tools**: Quality events for incremental compilation
5. **Test Runners**: Rapid events trigger test re-runs

## 🎨 Example: Custom Event Handler

```rust
use forge::{ForgeWatcher, Operation, OperationType};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    let watcher = ForgeWatcher::new("./src", false, vec![]).await?;

    // The watcher automatically handles events internally
    // and prints detailed logs for rapid + quality events

    watcher.run().await?;
    Ok(())
}
```

## 🚀 Advanced Features

### CRDT Synchronization

```rust
use forge::ForgeWatcher;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    // Enable sync with remote peer
    let watcher = ForgeWatcher::new(
        ".",
        true,  // enable_sync
        vec!["ws://localhost:3000/ws".to_string()]
    ).await?;

    watcher.run().await?;
    Ok(())
}
```

### Operation Log Access

```rust
use forge::{Database, OperationLog};
use std::sync::Arc;

let db = Database::new(".dx/forge")?;
let oplog = Arc::new(OperationLog::new(Arc::new(db)));

// Query operations for a file
// oplog.get_file_operations("src/main.rs")?;
```

## 🎯 Performance Optimization Techniques

1. **Zero-copy I/O**: Memory-mapped files via `memmap2`
2. **SIMD acceleration**: Fast byte comparison via `memchr`
3. **Atomic operations**: Lock-free sequence counters
4. **OS cache warming**: Pre-load all files at startup
5. **Lazy allocation**: Defer expensive operations until needed
6. **Parallel processing**: `rayon` for large file diffs
